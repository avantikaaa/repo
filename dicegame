'''write a program which accepts an input number N. Simulate a dice game of 2 players A&B. Each of the players takes turns to roll a 6 faced dice and sums their results. The player whose sum of dice roll results reaches N first wins the game. If someone rolls a 6 on dice, he gets another turn. For example:
 
Say N=10
A.             B
5              1
4              4
1              2
Output: A wins.
Explanation: at end of four rounds sum of A's roll = 10 and B's roll = 7
 

Example 2:
N=30
A.      B
6,4.    2
1.      6,6,1
5       5
5       6,1
4.      5
 Output: B wins.
 
If both reach N in the same turn whose sum is bigger wins and if that is equal it is a tie.
